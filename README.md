## University of California, Davis, Senior Design Project</br>

Worked in a team of five undergraduates in the department of mechanical engineering to create a robot capable of tying a shoe with the following design restraints:
- Max of two actuators
- $600 budget

Robot won an annual UC Davis robotics competition and was featured on several [news sites](https://github.com/QuantuMope/grimdor-shoe-tying-robot/blob/master/shoe-tying-robot-press.txt) as well as broadcasted on networks such as CBS and NBC. </br>

Repository contains reports discussing design theory, CAD, circuit design, and controller code. </br>
