# [Grimdor: Shoe Tying Robot](https://asjchoi.wixsite.com/portfolio/shoe-tying-robot).
#### My senior design project at UC Davis.</br>
Created a robot capable of tying a shoe with the design restraints:
- Only being able to use two motors
- $600 budget. </br>

Robot won an annual UC Davis robotics competition and was featured on several [news sites](https://github.com/QuantuMope/grimdor-shoe-tying-robot/blob/master/shoe-tying-robot-press.txt) as well as broadcasted on networks such as CBS and NBC. </br>

Repository contains reports, CAD, circuit design, and controller code. </br>
Kept on GitHUB for archiving purposes.
