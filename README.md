# Grimdor: Shoe Tying Robot.
My senior design project at UC Davis. Created a robot capable of tying a shoe with the 
design restraints of only being able to use two motors and a $600 budget. 
Robot won an annual UC Davis robotics design competition.
Featured on several news sites as well as broadcasted on networks such as CBS and NBC.
Repository contains reports, CAD, circuit design, and controller code.
Kept on GitHUB for archiving purposes.
